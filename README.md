# Multi-frequency Models for AART
This repository is an altered version of AART, a full detailed description of which is at https://github.com/iAART/aart.

These alterations focuson various physical parameters affecting the AART emission profile behavior. The simulation includes calculations of temperature, density, magnetic fields, and specific intensity, tailored for astrophysical contexts.

## Installation

To use this simulation, clone the repository and install the required packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/black-hole-simulation.git
cd black-hole-simulation
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Ensure you have Python 3.x and the following libraries installed:

    NumPy

    Astropy
    lmfit

Key Features

    Temperature, Density Profiles, and Magnetic Field Strength: Calculate the electron temperature and density as functions of distance from the black hole, as well as the Magnetic field strength.
    Synchrotron Emission: Models synchrotron radiation for different configurations and astrophysical parameters.
    Noisy Density and Temperature Profiles: Incorporates noise in density and temperature for realistic simulations.

Parameters

The following parameters can be adjusted to modify the simulation:

    Mass: Mass of the black hole.
    Observation Frequency: Frequency of observation in Hz.
    Scale Height: The slope of the accretion disk height vs radius.
    Initial Conditions: Various coefficients and exponents related to density, temperature, and magnetic field strength power laws.
    Function keys: The choice to add Inoisy purturbations to the density, temperature, and/or magnetic field strength power laws.

Refer to the code comments for detailed descriptions of each parameter and its units.
